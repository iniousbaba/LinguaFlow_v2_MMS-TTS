# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code-reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the work product, not your thought process, and preserves your own context for continued work.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing a major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing a complex bug

## How to Request

### 1. Get git SHAs

```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

### 2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent

Provide the reviewer with:
- `WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED` — What you just built
- `PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS` — What it should do
- `BASE_SHA` — Starting commit
- `HEAD_SHA` — Ending commit
- `DESCRIPTION` — Brief summary

### 3. Act on feedback

- Fix **Critical** issues immediately
- Fix **Important** issues before proceeding
- Note **Minor** issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with technical reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed: Add Hausa TTS support]

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "prior task" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch code-reviewer subagent]
  WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: Hausa TTS via gTTS with language code ha
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 3 from implementation plan
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661
  DESCRIPTION: Added ha language support to LinguaFlowTTS

[Subagent returns]:
  Issues:
    Important: Missing fallback for unsupported gTTS locales
    Minor: Hardcoded temp file path
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**
- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**
- Review after each batch (3 tasks)
- Get feedback, apply, continue

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer is wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
